Extended basic linked list implementation to do some pretty cool stuff. Also played around with some wrappers.

## Linked List:

* `__iter__` : allows for the linked list to be iterated over
* `__eq__` : allows for checking to see if two linked lists are equal
* `__add__` : allows the concatenation of two linked lists into one linked list.

## Wrappers:

* `timing` : times how long a function takes to run
* `intro_outro` : inserts an intro and outro before and after a given function return
